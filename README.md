# FPGA-based-Image-Edge-Detection
<br>
This project demonstrates edge detection on the PYNQ-Z2 FPGA using Vitis HLS and Vivado. The Sobel filter algorithm is hardware-accelerated through 2D convolution, achieving low latency, efficient resource utilization, and higher throughput compared to software-only implementations.
