## Prerequisites  

### What is Edge Detection?  
Edge detection is a fundamental step in image processing that identifies regions of rapid intensity change, which typically correspond to object boundaries or transitions in the scene.  

### Sobel Edge Detection  
The **Sobel operator** is a popular gradient-based method that uses **two 3Ã—3 convolution kernels** (for horizontal and vertical edge detection).  

1. Convert input image â†’ **grayscale** using:  
   \[
   Gray = 0.299R + 0.587G + 0.114B
   \]  

2. Convolve the grayscale image with **Gx** and **Gy** to compute intensity gradients:  
   \[
   Gx = I * Kx, \quad Gy = I * Ky
   \]  

3. Compute the **gradient magnitude**:  
   \[
   G = \sqrt{Gx^2 + Gy^2}
   \]  
   (In hardware, we often approximate with \(|Gx| + |Gy|\) for efficiency).  

4. Apply a **threshold** â†’ highlight strong edges, suppress weak ones.  

The result is an image where **edges are highlighted** (white) against a dark background.
